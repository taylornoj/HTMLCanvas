# HTML Canvas

Challenge 8/30 from the [JavaScript 30 challenge](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30) was to create an HTML canvas that you can paint on with your mouse.

When the mouse is clicked down, it is acting as a pen. When the mouse is up or goes off the browser page, the painting stops.  I set a starting colour and then used hsl to change the colour of the line as the mouse is dragged across the canvas.  

As a stretch feature I added a button to "Clear your Canvas" which resets the canvas to start again!

## What I learned:
- fundamentals of canvas
- base settings like lineJoin, lineCap and lineWidth
- although I didn't use it, I did play around with the globalCompositeOperation property which was really neat!
- hsl() - as opposed to RGB mdoel of defining colours, hsl uses hue (the colour itself), saturation (amount of colour) and lightness (the brightness of the colour)
- more experience with events!
